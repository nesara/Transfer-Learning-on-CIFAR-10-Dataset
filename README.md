# Transfer-Learning-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
Simple Transfer Learning on CIFAR 10 Dataset. 
It has become standard practice in computer vision tasks related to images, to use a convolutional network pre-trained as the backbone feature extraction network and train new layers on top for the target task. In this question we will implement such a model. We will use the VGG 11 bn network from the torchvision.models library as our backbone network. This model has been trained on ImageNet achieving top-5 error rate of 10.19%. It consists of 8 convolutional layers followed by adaptive average pooling and fully-connected layers to perform the classification. We will get rid of the averate pooling and fully-connected layers from the VGG 11 bn model and attach our own fully connected layers to perform the Cifar-10 classifcation.
